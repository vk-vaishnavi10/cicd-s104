    <p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is crucial for modern software development because it enables faster, more reliable, and more efficient software releases. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, CI/CD minimizes manual errors, accelerates development cycles, and allows for more frequent updates and feature releases. 
      This leads to quicker time to market, improved code quality, and enhanced collaboration among development teams. </p>
